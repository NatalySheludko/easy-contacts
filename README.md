Redux and Redux Toolkit were used for efficient state management, while Redux Persist was used to save the application's state between sessions. Data exchange with the server was handled via Axios and the app's UI was styled using Material UI. Formik was used for form management and data validation, and notifications were displayed using React Hot Toast. The core technologies of HTML and CSS were used for building and styling web pages.

## Development Tools:
The main development environment for the project was Microsoft Visual Studio Code, with Git for version control. The app was deployed and hosted on Vercel.

## Skills Acquired During the Project:
The project provided the opportunity to develop skills in research, problem solving and analytical thinking.
